      text: "ISLAMABAD: Dubai Land Department (DLD) has announced the launch of a new electronic service called Madmoun, which aims to enhance investor confidence and modernize real estate governance procedures. The service is accessible through the Trakheesi System and represented by a quick response code (QR code), issued for any real estate advertisement permit. Effective 24 April, all real estate companies are expected to feature the QR code on their print and audiovisual advertisements. This will allow customers to easily verify the advertisement’s authenticity and validity, ensuring that it has been approved by the Real Estate Regulatory Agency (RERA), which is responsible for regulating the real estate sector in Dubai. The code also allows customers to access DLD’s website to view the complete advertisement information, including details about the advertising company, the property’s condition, and specifications. In addition, the link can be secured to prevent any modification to the data, ensuring transparency in the real estate sector.",
